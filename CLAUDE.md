Guidance for Claude Code when working on this openpilot fork.

## Project Overview

**ExoPilot (EOP)** — Advanced ADAS for Rockchip RK3588.

- **Codebase**: OpenPilot fork + EOP-specific daemons, controllers, UI
- **Platform**: RK3588 (ExoPilot 01L / 01M). **02M/RK3576 is being handed to
  VisionPilot's `dev/02M` line** — see `docs/eop/BRANCH_NAMING.md`. The 02M UI
  (wide-screen telemetry side panel, `EOPTelemetryPanelWidth`, the split
  `MainWindow` layout) is **removed as of 2026-09-10**; `deviceScreenSize()` is
  now a constant 1024x600. The RK3576 *platform layer* — `system/hardware/rk3576/`,
  `PlatformType.RK3576`, `Hardware::RK3576()` — is still in-tree and still works,
  and moves once the VisionPilot port runs on real 02M hardware. ExoRobot 01H (RK3588 16GB, HumRobot) is in `~/robot/exorobot`
- **Suffix = RAM**: L=4GB / M=8GB / H=16GB; PCIe accel (camera-tier Hailo-8/DX-M1 only) is a runtime-detected plug-in, works unchanged on either SoC
- **Status**: In development — dev PC testing phase (not hardware-deployed)

## Prerequisites (on real hardware)

ExoPilot BSP must be installed first before openpilot:
```bash
sudo ~/pilot/exopilot/scripts/install/setup_rk3588.sh && sudo reboot   # ExoPilot 01L/01M
sudo ~/pilot/exopilot/scripts/install/setup_rk3576.sh && sudo reboot   # ExoPilot 02M
```
`setup_rk3576.sh`'s own header says it prepares the hardware layer "so
VisionPilot works correctly" — it predates openpilot's 02M support and was
written with only that consumer in mind, but the setup itself (kernel USB
hub driver, RTS5411S DT overlay, udev rules) is consumer-agnostic hardware
bring-up, not VisionPilot-specific software. Not verified against real
02M hardware from the openpilot side.

## Code Quality Standards

### When Reviewing/Fixing Code

1. **Feature/quality impact only** — Fix runtime bugs, not cosmetic issues
   - ✅ Missing imports, AttributeErrors, capnp API misuse, SQL constraint violations
   - ❌ Typos in comments, style reformatting, unused imports

2. **Capnp field assignment patterns**
   - `List(Struct)`: Use `init('field', count)` + `[i].attr = val` — never `.add()` or direct assignment
   - `List(primitive)`: Direct Python list assignment OK
   - See `selfdrive/controls/lib/*.py` for examples

3. **Daemon initialization** — All attributes used in `get_state()` must be initialized in `__init__`, not just in `update()` code paths

4. **Testing** — Code is at dev PC stage; hardware bugs lower priority than Python runtime crashes
   - Run `./test.sh` before pushing; it checks lint, shebangs, and the RK3588/Rockchip host-side pytest suites.
   - For the full upstream lint gate, run `./test.sh --full`.
   - Install pre-commit hooks: `uv pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`

### Build & Platform

- **SConstruct**: RK3588 maps to `aarch64`
- **launch_openpilot.sh**: RK3588 hardware only
- **Architecture decisions**: Prefer minimal overlays—revert to upstream, then re-apply only EOP additions

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | System design + daemon overview |
| `SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` | Hardware specs (RK3588) |
| `docs/eop/` | Feature documentation |
| `docs/eop/04_Integration/BLE_DESIGN.md` | BLE/NCP architecture (dual transport) |
| `docs/upstream-audit/DELTA_AUDIT.md` | Audit trail + revert plan |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent edit boundaries (local-only, read this first) |
| `test.sh` | Local dev gate before pushing |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Pre-commit hooks |
| `cereal/{log,custom}.capnp` | Message definitions |
| `common/core_config.py` | CPU affinity mapping |
| `system/bluetoothd/ble_gatt.py` | BLE GATT server (Nordic UART, iOS + Android) |
| `system/bluetoothd/spp.py` | Classic SPP server (RFCOMM, OBD scanners) |
| `selfdrive/adaptd/adaptd.py` | Adaptive driving daemon (renamed from elm327d) |
| `selfdrive/ui/eop/` | The UI — Qt Widgets in Python (PyQt5). Replaced the C++/Qt UI 2026-09-12 |

## Daemon Naming

| Old name | New name | Note |
|----------|----------|------|
| `elm327d` | `adaptd` | Renamed 2026-05-30 — never implemented ELM327; is a driving policy daemon |
| `radar3d.py` (camera+radar fusion) | `radard.py` | Renamed 2026-08-16 — matches upstream openpilot's name. `radar3d.py` is now the long-range UART radar *producer* daemon, not the fusion daemon; see New Features below |

## UI

The C++/Qt UI is gone. `selfdrive/ui/eop/` is a Qt Widgets UI written in
Python and run as a `PythonProcess`, and `dev/02M` uses the same module.

- **Design is unchanged on 01M.** Sidebar, offroad home, the left-nav settings
  window and the onroad HUD all reproduce the C++ layout they replace. `dev/02M`
  is where the new design lives (top-tab settings, swipeable side panels).
- **The split between the branches is only `views/`.** `qt.py`, `state.py`,
  `components/` and `views/panels/` are byte-identical on `dev/01M` and
  `dev/02M`, so a fix to any of them cherry-picks between branches unchanged.
  Check that before editing one of those files.
- **Binding**: PyQt5 by default, resolved through `selfdrive/ui/eop/qt.py`.
  Write `Signal`, never `pyqtSignal`; take `QOpenGLWidget` from the shim.
  `EOP_QT_BINDING=pyqt5|pyside2|pyside6` forces one, and the tests run under
  PyQt5 and PySide6 to prove the code stays neutral. PySide2 (LGPL) is the
  pre-ship target — PyQt5 is GPLv3 and openpilot is MIT.
- **Run it**: `PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m openpilot.selfdrive.ui.eop.main --demo`
- **Test it**: `./test.sh` now includes the UI suite, or directly with
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python3 -m pytest selfdrive/ui/eop/tests
  -c selfdrive/ui/eop/tests/pytest.ini --noconftest`
- **Not yet verified on hardware**: the VisionIPC/EGL camera path and which Qt
  platform plugin the device runs. See `docs/eop10/EOP10_PORT_PLAN.md` P1.

## New Features

**Optional USB eGPU camera shadow path (2026-08-23):**
- `tinygrad_repo` is pinned to the official stable `v0.13.0` tag; do not follow
  `master`. The deployed runtime must use Python 3.11+ (EOP `.venv` is 3.12).
- `inferenced` is the sole eGPU owner. `sided` and `reard` submit IPC jobs with
  direct fallback disabled and keep independent model IDs, Params, sessions,
  health and queues. Side and rear are not one combined model.
- Only `off` and `shadow` modes exist. Existing Hailo/local detections remain
  authoritative; no eGPU output is connected to planning or control.
- Corner-radar/4D point-cloud integration belongs to `../visionpilot`, outside
  this OpenPilot camera pipeline.
- Future AutoSpeed, AutoSteer and AutoDrive ONNX experiments must be independent,
  lower-priority compatibility references. Semantic segmentation is the main eGPU
  expansion: front plus independent side and rear sessions. Production driving
  inference must preserve openpilot `modeld`'s vision/policy runners, temporal
  buffers, output parsers and `modelV2` semantics. See
  `docs/eop/05_Features/EGPU_CAMERA_SHADOW.md`.
- For an authoritative external driving model, follow upstream Chestnut's one-way
  failover: keep the RKNN small model loaded/warm, reject activation unless the
  external model loads and warms, switch to RKNN on exception/timeout/non-finite
  output/unplug, soft-disable if engaged, and never auto-retry eGPU onroad. EOP's
  single device owner remains `inferenced`; `modeld` owns driving state and parsing.
  See `docs/eop/05_Features/CHESTNUT_EGPU_ADOPTION.md`.
- Driving artifacts are asymmetric by design: the eGPU target is official upstream
  Chestnut big supercombo; local fallback is the Bukapilot monolithic supercombo,
  converted and validated separately for RK3588 and RK3576. Never reuse an RKNN
  binary across target SoCs. First validate the exact Bukapilot ONNX on eGPU versus
  Bukapilot RKNN before introducing the different-generation upstream big model.

**radar3d — long-range UART radar replaces the never-wired OEM CAN radar (2026-08-16):**
- The vehicle has no real forward OEM radar — only a 2D blind-spot corner
  radar (`radar2d`, unchanged). `card.py` used to source the `radar3d`
  socket from `opendbc.car.tesla.radar_interface.RadarInterface`, decoding
  a Continental ARS4-B/TC375-BrownPanda CAN stream that was never actually
  wired to real hardware — a second, more complete decoder
  (`continental_interface.py`) existed alongside it and was never imported
  either. Both removed; `card.py` no longer touches radar at all.
- New standalone producer `selfdrive/controls/radar3d.py` (`Radar3DD`,
  Class-D pattern) reads a long-range UART radar sensor directly (77GHz,
  up to 120m, onboard CFAR/AoA — no local DSP needed) and publishes
  `car.RadarData` on the `radar3d` socket at 20Hz. No capnp changes —
  `RadarPoint`'s existing fields covered everything the sensor provides.
- `radar3d` feeds two independent, complementary consumers: `radard.py`
  (renamed from this repo's old `radar3d.py` — see Daemon Naming above)
  for ACC ego-lane lead tracking, and `gridd.py`'s pre-existing
  `_fuse_radar3d()` for forward adjacent-lane (merge/cut-in) awareness —
  the latter already existed and needed zero changes.
- Driver lives in `../exopilot/hal/hal/drivers/radar/radar3d.py` (`Radar3D`,
  `Radar3DConfig`) — low-level sensor porting can't live in this public
  repo, same ownership split as BGT60TR13C. See
  `docs/eop/04_Integration/TC375_RADAR.md` for the full wire contract,
  sign-convention bench-verify items, and file map.
- OpenPilot no longer owns a `radar4d` runtime. Future ESP32 corner-radar
  point-cloud work is scoped to VisionPilot; OpenPilot keeps only its current
  radar interfaces and camera consumers.

**BRSC — Bumpy Road Speed Controller (2026-08-03):**
- Reduces cruise speed / positive accel on rough pavement, detected from vertical
  IMU acceleration (`accelerometer` service, not vision — complements VTSC/MTSC
  which only see path curvature). Real-world tuned: isolated single-spike events
  (railroad crossing, one pothole) don't trigger a slowdown; sustained roughness
  (washboard/broken pavement) does; recovery ramps back over a few seconds instead
  of stepping, and a retriggerable hold (capped) rides out closely-spaced bumps.
- Pure policy lives in `nagaspilot/controls/ngp_brsc.py` (`NGPBRSC` class, zero
  cereal/Params deps) so the identical file ports to `dev/NGP10` and `dev/EDP10`.
  `NGP`-prefixed (not `EOP`-prefixed) param `ngp_lon_brsc` is a deliberate
  exception to the `EOP<Feature><Param>` rule, made for features shared verbatim
  across branches — see `docs/eop/03_Software/Controllers/BRSC.md`.
- EOP10 wiring: `selfdrive/controls/plannerd.py` (subscribes `accelerometer`) +
  `selfdrive/controls/lib/longitudinal_planner.py` (same `_apply_speed_limit`
  pattern as SQSC/RCD/TLSC — applied after VTSC/MTSC's curve-speed blend).
- capnp: `LongitudinalPlan.ngpBrscActive/ngpBrscSpeed/ngpBrscRoughness` (`log.capnp` @66-68).
- Tests: `nagaspilot/tests/test_ngp_brsc.py` (pure-Python, no capnp/build needed).

## Recent Bug Fixes

**`_FuseHost` test double out of sync with `GridD` — gridd (2026-08-10):**
- `fix(gridd): wire up load_corner_poses()` (c9b5df77f) moved
  `_fuse_radar2d_objects`'s corner-pose lookup from the `_R2D_CORNER_POSE`
  class constant to `self._r2d_corner_pose`, an instance attribute set in
  `GridD.__init__()`. `test_fuse_radar2d.py`'s `_FuseHost` — a deliberate
  lightweight stand-in that mirrors `GridD`'s class-level constants without
  running its (heavy) `__init__` — was never updated, so every test using it
  hit `AttributeError: '_FuseHost' object has no attribute
  '_r2d_corner_pose'`. Fixed by adding `_r2d_corner_pose = GridD._R2D_CORNER_POSE`
  to `_FuseHost`, matching the same placeholder-table fallback
  `GridD.__init__` itself falls back to when the shared registry is absent.

**Hailo-8 multi-process VDevice race — sided/reard (2026-08-10):**
- `sided` (side_left/side_right) and `reard` (rear) run as separate concurrent
  processes but share one physical Hailo-8 over the same USB hub. Both used to
  call `InferenceClient.hailo()` directly, each creating its own `VDevice()`;
  HailoRT only grants one process exclusive ownership (no multi-process
  scheduler service running), so whichever daemon started second failed
  `initialize()` silently and its CPU fallback returned `[]` — only one of
  side/rear ever actually got YOLO detections.
- Fixed by routing `HailoSideDetector` (`selfdrive/sided/hailo_side_detector.py`,
  shared by `sided.py`/`reard.py`) through `InferenceClient(daemon_name,
  use_ipc=True).submit_job(BackendType.HAILO_8, ...)` so only `inferenced`
  ever touches `Hailo8Backend`/`VDevice`; added `yolo_side` → `models/hef/
  yolov8n.hef` to `inferenced.py`'s `MODEL_REGISTRY` (its path resolver
  previously assumed every model was `{fmt}/{ext}` templated for rknn/onnx,
  which doesn't apply to fixed-format `.hef` files). Also made
  `InferenceClient._hal` lazy (`system/inferenced/client.py`) so constructing
  a client no longer eagerly initializes every local backend — the
  side-effect that caused the eager per-process `VDevice()` grab in the first
  place. See `docs/INFERENCED_ARCHITECTURE.md` "Hailo Backend" for the
  IPC-only rule.

**BLE / Bluetooth stack (2026-05-31):**
- `ncp_session.py`: multiple `PubMaster` instances for same service crashed msgq on boot — fixed with one shared session per process
- `ncp_session.py`: `NCPSession.start()` not idempotent (spawned duplicate telem threads); fixed with guard
- `ncp_session.py` / `spp.py`: missing `voiceCommandRequest` in `cereal/services.py` — PubMaster construction crash
- `spp.py`: socket write race — `Client._send_lock` and `_send_locked` were independent; fixed with shared lock per connection
- `ble_gatt.py`: GATT TX chunk interleave — `PropertiesChanged` emitted outside `_lock`; fixed
- `ble_gatt.py`: `StartNotify`/`StopNotify` not wired to session — route state never reset between connections
- `bluetoothd.py`: `int(bytes)` TypeError for `EOPBluetoothPairWindow` param
- `protocol.py`: command codes 0x22–0x2F did not match Dart `frame_protocol.dart` — all NCP commands silently misrouted

**Earlier (2026-05-30):**
- `spp.py`: missing `import struct`, missing `_handle_voice_intent` / `_handle_driving_profile` handlers
- `pairing_agent.py`: wrong BlueZ capability (`DisplayYesNo` → `DisplayOnly`), missing `DisplayPasskey`
- `bluetoothd.py`: GLib main loop never ran
- `adaptd`: not in `process_config.py`; `EOPAdaptdEnabled` undefined in `params_keys.h`
- `BluetoothPairingPin/Addr/Active`, `EOPDeviceName`, `EOPAdaptdEnabled` missing from `params_keys.h`

See `docs/upstream-audit/DELTA_AUDIT.md` Step 15 for earlier Python runtime bugs (thermald, sqsc, camera_calibrationd, surface_quality_db, eop_utils).

## Lint & Code Quality (2026-08-12)

A focused lint cleanup landed on `dev/EOP10`:

- `./test.sh` (focused gate) is green.
- `./test.sh --full` is green for ruff, shebang, large-file, merge-marker, and codespell checks; only mypy debt remains (553 errors in 149 files, down from ~740/203).
- Real runtime bugs fixed: `gridd/yolo_objdet.py` wrong result attributes, `surfaced/surfaced.py` missing `CellState` aliases, `system/hardware/rk_device_id.py` mixed bytes/str reads.
- ~200 shebang files marked executable; pre-existing large assets excluded from the 120 KB gate; codespell ignore-list expanded for EOP/Rockchip domain terms.

See `docs/eop/CODE_QUALITY_LINT_CLEANUP.md` for the full report and recommended next steps.

**Last updated**: 2026-09-12  
**Branch**: dev/01M (renamed from dev/EOP10, 2026-09-10)

`dev/EOP10` is kept as-is: it is the archive of the original C++/Qt UI, and
nothing should be pushed to it.

## Local Inference Stack

This workstation runs a two-tier local inference stack. All code changes use local GPU+CPU automatically — no flag needed. Use `// --claude` to skip local and go cloud-only.

```
:8000  GPU  Qwen3-Coder-30B AWQ    (RTX 3090) — code generation, 20-30 tok/s
:8001  CPU  DeepSeek-R1-70B Q8_0   (i9-13900K) — deep review, 2-4 tok/s
:8002  LiteLLM proxy               — unified endpoint, auto-failover
```

### Usage

```
# Local (free — GPU codes, CPU reviews in parallel)
You: "fix the capnp list assignment in adaptd.py"

# Deep review (safety-critical, arch, auth)
You: "review the BLE session state machine @deep"

# Cloud only
You: "design the new daemon lifecycle architecture // --claude"
```

### Task Tiers

| Tier | Type | Review timeout |
|------|------|---------------|
| 1 Quick fix | rename, typo, comment | 300s |
| 2 Routine | fix bug, add function, test | 900s |
| 3 Moderate | refactor, new module | 1800s |
| 4 Deep | arch, safety-critical, auth | 2400s |

Add `// @deep` to force Tier 4 on any task.

### Check Status

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8002/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-local-dev-not-secret" | jq '.data[].id'
```

See `~/RTX3090/` for full setup and service management.
