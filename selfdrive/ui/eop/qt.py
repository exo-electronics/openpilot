"""Qt binding shim.

The target is **Ubuntu 22.04 on RK3576**, i.e. Qt 5.15 — the same Qt the
existing C++ UI already runs on that device. Three bindings can supply it and
all three are packaged for jammy on arm64, so the choice is not about
availability:

- **PyQt5** (`python3-pyqt5`) — the default here. Nagasware's 48,545 LOC of UI
  is written against it, so the port starts with zero conversion, and this is
  a research project where the GPL is not yet a constraint.
- **PySide2** (`python3-pyside2`) — LGPLv3. The one to move to **before
  anything ships**, because PyQt5 is GPLv3 or a paid Riverbank licence and
  openpilot is MIT; distributing a PyQt5 UI would force GPL on the combined
  work. See docs/eop10/EOP10_PORT_PLAN.md section 12.1.
- **PySide6** — Qt6, not in jammy, no aarch64 wheels. Dev machines newer than
  the target tend to have it, so it is accepted as a last resort.

Deferring the licence decision is cheap *only if the code does not accumulate
binding-specific spellings in the meantime*, which is what this module is for.
Write `Signal`, never `pyqtSignal`; take `QOpenGLWidget` from here, not from a
binding module; use unscoped enum access (`Qt.WA_TranslucentBackground`),
which is native in Qt5 and accepted by PySide6's forgiveness mode. Held to
that, switching to PySide2 later is an edit to this file rather than a pass
over the whole UI.

`EOP_QT_BINDING=pyqt5|pyside2|pyside6` forces a specific binding, for testing
that the code really is neutral.
