"""Offroad settings.

Nagasware's navigation model, not openpilot's (plan section 5.5): a horizontal
tab bar across the top with grouped pages below, rather than a left sidebar
over a long scrolling list. The geometry decides it -- 1600x600 leaves 500px
of content height between the bars, and a sidebar spends the scarce axis while
tabs spend the abundant one.

Pages are built from `settings/descriptor.py`, so adding a control is a data
change and the coverage gate can prove nothing was dropped.

The descriptor covers the EOP settings only. The openpilot panels -- Device,
WiFi, Bluetooth, Toggles, Software, Developer -- are hand-written and live in
views/panels/, shared byte-for-byte with dev/01M. They are tabs here rather
than a sidebar, which is the only difference between the two branches'
settings. They were missing entirely until now, and the WiFi one is not
optional: with no way to join a network there is no way to update and no way
to pair a phone, so the device has no recovery path but SSH.
